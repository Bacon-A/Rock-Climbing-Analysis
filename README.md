# Rock-Climbing-Analysis

This repository contains code used for an analysis on the top 200 most popular rock climbing routes in central utah found on the [Mountain Project.](https://www.mountainproject.com/) <br>

Code for scraping their data is found in the Climbing_Scrape.ipynb.

Data.csv is where I exported the data that I pulled. 

EDA.ipynb contains the code used to create several graphics that help us visualize the data.

Plot.png is a big-picture graphic showing the overall trends of these most popular routes.

For more details about the web scrape, the graphics, or the overall trends of the data, my blog contains a post on each. [Blog]https://bacon-a.github.io/stat386-projects/
